# nvim

This is my custom Neovim configuration, designed with love and optimized for productivity. :heart:

## Design Philosophy

- **Maximize functionality, minimize bloat**: Focus on essential features and performance.
- **Leverage native Neovim capabilities**: Before introducing plugins, I check if the desired functionality can be achieved using built-in Neovim commands.
- **Organized keymaps**: Every keymap is categorized with a brief description and a pretext header for easy fuzzy finding. Commands are grouped logically for efficiency.
- **Mnemonic-friendly keymaps**: Keybindings are intuitive, following familiar patterns where possible to enhance usability and reduce cognitive load.
- **Eye-catching, comfortable themes**: A killer set of themes that are easy on the eyes and a joy to work in.
- **Must be better than VS Code**: Because well...

## Requirements

- **[Python]( https://www.python.org/downloads/ )**
  ```bash
  pip install pynvim ipykernel jupytext
  ```
- **Windows ([Scoop](https://scoop.sh)):**  
  ```bash
  scoop install neovim git zig nodejs ripgrep fd wget unzip gzip mingw make
  ```
- **macOS (Homebrew):**  
  ```bash
  brew install neovim git zig nodejs ripgrep fd wget unzip gzip make
  ```
- **Linux (apt):**  
  ```bash
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/unstable -y
  ```
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  ```
  ```bash
  sudo apt install make gcc ripgrep unzip git xclip neovim
  ```

## Setting Up Your Config

You have two options:

1. **Clone the repo to any location, then copy it to your config path:**

   **ðŸ’¡ Note:** Run these commands from inside the cloned directory!

   - **Windows (cmd):**
     ```bash
     xcopy /E /H /Y . %localappdata%\nvim\
     rd /s /q %localappdata%\nvim\.git
     ```

   - **macOS/Linux:**
     ```bash
     cp -r . "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
     rm -rf "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim/.git
     ```

2. **Clone the repo directly to your config path:**

    - **Windows (cmd):**
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/Or1g3n/nvim.git "%localappdata%\nvim"
        rd /s /q "%localappdata%\nvim\.git"
        ```

    - **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/Or1g3n/nvim.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
        rm -rf "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim/.git
        ```

- **Optimized jupyter notebook experience**
    - **jupytext**
        - Add jupytext.toml to your home directory with below settings
            ```toml
            # ~/jupytext.toml
            notebook_metadata_filter="-all"
            cell_metadata_filter="-all"
            ```
    - **To initializing a new notebook, run the following nvim command**

       **ðŸ’¡ Note:** To enter command mode, press `:` from normal mode.

        ```vim
        :NewNoteBook note_book_name
        ```

- **Client specific customizations**

    This configuration allows adding client specific customizations via files added to the local folder (.gitignore in the root config directory excludes this folder). The idea here is that certain configurations such as bookmarks, llm api keys/adapters, or project directories are specific to certain machine and should not be included in git history.

    Below highlights the required local directory structure and the currently supported plugin customizations.

    ```bash
    nvim/
    | after/
    | lua/
    | | Or1g3n/
    | | | plugins/
    | | | | local/
    | | | | | alpha/
    | | | | | | greeting.lua
    | | | | | | messages.lua
    | | | | | codecompanion/
    | | | | | | custom_adapter.lua
    | | | | | minifiles/
    | | | | | | bookmarks.lua
    | | | | | pyproject_selector/
    | | | | | | pyprojects.lua
    ```

    - alpha (Neovim dashboard plugin)
        - To customize dashboard greeting, default is `Welcome to Neovim!`. Add the following `greeting.lua` to the local/alpha directory (create if it doesn't exist).
            ```lua
            -- nvim/lua/Or1g3n/plugins/local/alpha/greeting.lua
            return "My custom greeting!"
            ```

        - To customize dashboard random message, default is `Make it a great day`. Add the following `messages.lua` to the local/alpha directory (create if it doesn't exist).
            ```lua
            -- nvim/lua/Or1g3n/plugins/local/alpha/messages.lua.lua
            return {
                { message = "Random Message 1" },
                { message = "Random Message 2" },
            }
            ```

    - mini.files (File Explorer)
        - To customize mini.files bookmarks. Add the following `bookmarks.lua` to the local/minifiles directory (create if it doesn't exist).
            ```lua
            -- nvim/lua/Or1g3n/plugins/local/minifiles/bookmarks.lua
            return {
                { id = "r", path = "~/repos", desc = "Repos directory" },
                { id = "p", path = "~/Python", desc = "Python directory" },
            }
            ```

    - pyproject_selector (Python Project Selector)
        - To customize pyproject_selector picker. Add the following `pyprojects.lua` to the local/pyproject_selector directory (create if it doesn't exist).
        - To activate the picker, press `<Leader>pp`.
        - Selecting a project will automatically set the working directory to `dir` and activate the python virtual environment specified by `venv`.
            ```lua
            -- nvim/lua/Or1g3n/plugins/local/pyproject_selector/pyprojects.lua
            return {
              {
                name = "project_1",
                dir  = "C:/Users/MyUser/repos/project_1",
                venv = "C:/Users/MyUser/repos/project_1/.venv",
              },
                name = "project_2",
                dir  = "C:/Users/MyUser/repos/project_2",
                venv = "C:/Users/MyUser/repos/project_2/.venv",
              },
            }
            ```

    - codecompanion (LLM Agent)
        - To add custom codecompanion LLM adapters. Add the following `custom_adapter.lua` to the local/codecompanion directory (create if it doesn't exist).
        - Note, the below is an example and should be updated with your specific requirements. To complete the configuration, update the codecompanion config file found at `nvim/lua/Or1g3n/plugins/codecompanion.lua`.
            ```lua
            -- nvim/lua/Or1g3n/plugins/local/codecompanion/custom_adapter.lua
            -- 
            local M = {}

            M.config = {
                env = {
                    url             = "https://myllm.url.com",
                    api_key         = "my_api_key",
                    chat_url        = "/v1/chat/completions",
                    models_endpoint = "/v1/models",
                },
                schema = {
                    model = {
                        default = "mistralai/Pixtral-12B-2409",
                    },
                },
            }

            return M
            ```
